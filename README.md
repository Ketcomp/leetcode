LeetCode problem solutions.

# How to contribute
Code:
Create a new branch for your language/problem combo: e.g. When on Master, `git checkout -b python/TwoSum` or `git checkout -b java/TwoSum` etc.
Create a pull-request once your code is complete. Work on CR suggestions and your branch will be merged in Master.

Comments:
You can also write up doc-blocks or comments for tricky code - even if you aren't the author of that code.

Test cases:
If you can come up with test cases that may test the code to its limits, contribute those as well.

# Document code
- I encourage you to put space and run-time complexity in the docblock.
